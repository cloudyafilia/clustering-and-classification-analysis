# clustering-and-classification-analysis
This project was created based on a task from Dicodingâ€™s Machine Learning for Beginners course. The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle, specifically about gun incident cases. The project involves two stages: clustering the data to find meaningful patterns and performing classification to predict incident categories.
